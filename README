I stopped working on this project in fall of 2011. I built it to see if I could create something scrummy-like but yet still hang with traditional waterfall project management.  It didn't work - now, there is Trello and a host of other products that are much "lighter" and cooler.

So, this project is a great example of throwing up blocks on a screen and then being able to move them around or copy them from one location to the next.

The interesting thing is that the blocks are hierarchical (milestones/tasks).

Have at it.  If you do something useful with it, I would love to see a screen shot or perhaps you can tweet about it to @johnstack

Keep the right end up!!!
